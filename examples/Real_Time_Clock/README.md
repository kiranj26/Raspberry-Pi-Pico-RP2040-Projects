# Real-Time Clock (RTC) Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Real-Time Clock (RTC) on the Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040. It sets the current time and then prints the time every second.

## Hardware Details

### Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040

The Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 is a versatile microcontroller designed for a wide range of applications. It features:
- **CPU**: Dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor.
- **Memory**: 264 KB of SRAM, 2 MB of Flash memory.
- **Peripherals**: GPIO, PWM, ADC, I2C, SPI, UART, and more.
- **Package**: Available in a 40-pin DIP package.

## Software Details

### Prerequisites
- **Thonny IDE**: Download and install from [here](https://thonny.org/).
- **MicroPython**: Follow the instructions to set up [MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico).

### Instructions

1. **Open Thonny IDE**.
2. **Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico** to your computer via USB.
3. **Select the Raspberry Pi Pico interpreter** from the bottom-right corner in Thonny.
4. **Create a New File**:
    - Click `File -> New`.
    - Copy the content from the `main.py` provided in this folder.
    - Save the file as `main.py` on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
5. **Run the Program**:
    - The current date and time will be printed every second.

### Code Explanation

#### main.py
This code initializes the Real-Time Clock (RTC) on the Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040. It sets the current date and time and then prints the time every second.
