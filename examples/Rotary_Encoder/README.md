# Rotary Encoder Example

This example demonstrates how to use a rotary encoder with the Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040. The rotary encoder is connected to GPIO pins 14 and 15.

## Hardware Details

### Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040

The Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 is a versatile microcontroller designed for a wide range of applications. It features:
- **CPU**: Dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor.
- **Memory**: 264 KB of SRAM, 2 MB of Flash memory.
- **Peripherals**: GPIO, PWM, ADC, I2C, SPI, UART, and more.
- **Package**: Available in a 40-pin DIP package.

### Rotary Encoder

A rotary encoder is an electromechanical device that converts the angular position or motion of a shaft or axle to an analog or digital signal.

## Software Details

### Prerequisites
- **Thonny IDE**: Download and install from [here](https://thonny.org/).
- **MicroPython**: Follow the instructions to set up [MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico).

### Instructions

1. **Hardware Setup**:
    - Connect the rotary encoder to GPIO pins 14 (pin A) and 15 (pin B).
    - Ensure the rotary encoder's VCC and GND are connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico's 3.3V and GND, respectively.
2. **Open Thonny IDE**.
3. **Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico** to your computer via USB.
4. **Select the Raspberry Pi Pico interpreter** from the bottom-right corner in Thonny.
5. **Create a New File**:
    - Click `File -> New`.
    - Copy the content from the `main.py` provided in this folder.
    - Save the file as `main.py` on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
6. **Run the Program**:
    - Rotate the encoder and observe the position value printed in the console.

### Code Explanation

#### main.py
This code initializes GPIO pins 14 and 15 as input pins for the rotary encoder. It uses interrupts to detect changes in the encoder's state and updates the position accordingly. The position value is printed to the console whenever the encoder is rotated.
