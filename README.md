## Introduction
The Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 microcontroller is a versatile platform designed for a wide range of applications. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of examples and projects that demonstrate the diverse capabilities of this microcontroller, from basic input/output operations to complex control systems.

## Getting Started
To get started with the projects in this repository, you'll need the following tools and software:
- **Thonny IDE**: The recommended integrated development environment (IDE) for developing applications on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
- **MicroPython**: A lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language for microcontrollers.

### Installation Steps
1. Download and install [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/).
2. Follow the instructions to set up [MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico).

## Repository Structure
- `examples/`: Contains various example projects showcasing the use of different peripherals on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
- `assignments/`: Contains assignments created to help Professor Ariella Blum and her students in LAB ECEN 2400.
