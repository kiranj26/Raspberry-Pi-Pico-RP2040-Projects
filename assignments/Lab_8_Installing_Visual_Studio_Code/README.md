# Lab 8: Installing Visual Studio Code and Blinking the Onboard LED

This lab guides students through the installation of Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as a development environment for programming the Raspberry Pi Pico using MicroPython. After installing VSCode and configuring the Pico for MicroPython, students will verify the setup by blinking the onboard LED.
