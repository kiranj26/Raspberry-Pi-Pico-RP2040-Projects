# Assignments for ECEN 2400: Applications of Embedded Systems

**These assignments were created by Kiran Jojare as a graduate teaching assistant for the course ECEN 2400: Applications of Embedded Systems, under the guidance of Professor Ariella Blum.**

This folder contains a collection of assignments designed to help students understand and implement various embedded systems concepts using the Raspberry Pi Pico. Each assignment focuses on different peripherals and functionalities, providing a comprehensive learning experience.

## Table of Contents
- [Lab 8: Installing Visual Studio Code](#lab-8-installing-visual-studio-code)
- [Lab 13 Part 1: SBB IR Receiver & Programming](#lab-13-part-1-sbb-ir-receiver--programming)
- [Lab 13 Part 2: SBB IR Transmitter & Receiver](#lab-13-part-2-sbb-ir-transmitter--receiver)

### Lab 8: Installing Visual Studio Code
This lab guides students through the process of installing Visual Studio Code, setting up the development environment for programming the Raspberry Pi Pico, and writing a simple Python script to ensure everything is correctly configured.

**Folder Contents:**
- `Lab8_Installing_Visual_Studio_Code.docx`: The lab document with step-by-step instructions for setting up Visual Studio Code.
- `main.py`: Example code to verify the installation and setup.

### Lab 13 Part 1: SBB IR Receiver & Programming
This lab introduces students to the practical aspects of infrared (IR) communication. Students will learn how to set up an IR receiver circuit with the Raspberry Pi Pico, decode NEC protocol frames, and use this knowledge to control actions based on IR commands.

**Folder Contents:**
- `Lab13_SBB_IR_Receiver_Programming.docx`: The lab document with detailed instructions and explanations.
- `main.py`: Example code for receiving and decoding IR signals.

### Lab 13 Part 2: SBB IR Transmitter & Receiver
Building on the previous lab, this lab covers both transmission and reception of IR signals. Students will set up an IR communication system, encode and send IR signals using an IR LED transmitter, and receive and decode these signals with an IR receiver.

**Folder Contents:**
- `Lab13_Part2_SBB_IR_TX_RX.docx`: The lab document with comprehensive instructions for both IR transmission and reception.
- `main.py`: Example code for sending IR signals (transmitter).
- `main.py`: Example code for receiving IR signals (receiver).
