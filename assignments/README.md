## Introduction
This folder includes detailed lab assignments designed to teach students how to work with the Raspberry Pi Pico and other related software tools. Each lab focuses on specific topics, ranging from setting up development environments to programming microcontrollers using MicroPython.

## Assignment Details

### Lab 8: Installing Visual Studio Code and Blinking the Onboard LED
- **Document**: `Lab8_Installing_Visual_Studio_Code.docx`
- **Description**: This lab guides students through the installation of Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and configuring it for programming the Raspberry Pi Pico using MicroPython. The lab includes steps for installing Python 3, configuring system variables, and setting up VSCode with necessary extensions. It concludes with a hands-on exercise to blink the onboard LED of the Raspberry Pi Pico.
- **Files**:
  - `Lab8_Installing_Visual_Studio_Code.docx`: Detailed instructions for the lab.
  - `main.py`: Example code to blink the onboard LED.

### Future Labs
- **Lab 9**: TBD (Include a brief description of future labs you have developed)
- **Lab 10**: TBD (Include a brief description of future labs you have developed)

## My Role
As a Graduate Student Assistant for the ECEN 2400 course, my responsibilities included:
